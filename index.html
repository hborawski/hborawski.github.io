<h1>Harris Borawski - Software Engineer</h1>
<p>As a software engineer it is my goal to create software that is easy to use for end users, but easy to use for developers. Well written, testable and maintainable code is just as important as any customer facing features and by applying what I have learned at the Rochester Institute of Technology, this is a goal I can and will achieve.</p>
